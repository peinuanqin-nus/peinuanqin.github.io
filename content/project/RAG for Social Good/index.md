Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG) is a means to provide more precise solutions based on LLM and effectively avoid the problem of illusions. I am committed to collaborating with other PhD students from different research fields to expand the application of the RAG system to various fields, such as social stigma, academic support, etc.; these works are currently in progress.
