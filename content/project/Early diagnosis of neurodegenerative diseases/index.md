Neurodegenerative diseases are usually evaluated based on some artificially determined scales, which face a large error in the process. Therefore, we have developed a precise evaluation scheme for neurodegenerative diseases based on gait recognition of the elderly using deep neural network technology. We can conveniently collect patients' gait data in a non-contact manner and provide accurate judgment parameters for doctors. The corresponding product has been quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated in top hospitals in China, and the results show that this technology can effectively improve the efficiency of medical staff in collecting patient information and enhance patients' experience during treatment.
