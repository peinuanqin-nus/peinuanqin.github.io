Cyberbullying is a prevalent form of online violence with serious consequences. Bystanders, who form the largest group of witnesses, often observe cyberbullying without taking any preventative action. In light of this, we explored the challenges that hinder bystanders from directly intervening and developed AI-driven interfaces aimed at encouraging them to take an active role in mitigating cyberbullying. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we successfully promoted direct bystander actions to stop the aggressor or support the victim. Additionally, we demonstrated the potential of AI in cyberbullying mitigation and proposed directions for future research.

<!-- Cyberbullying is a common online violence that has serious consequences. Bystanders, as the largest group, always witness cyberbullying instead of taking any preventive action. Given this, we investigated the challenges of bystanders that prevent them from direct intervention and designed AI-driven interfaces to successfully promote them participating cyberbullying mitigation in a direct way. -->
