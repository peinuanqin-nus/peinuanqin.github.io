In multilingual communication settings, non-native speakers (NNS) often find themselves at a disadvantage compared to native speakers (NS). While much previous research has focused on enhancing their participation in conversations, there remains a lack of real-time communication support tools specifically designed to assist non-native speakers in organizing and expressing their thoughts effectively. To address this gap, we first conducted studies to investigate the unique challenges non-native speakers face during communication and developed AI-based real-time speaking support solutions tailored to these difficulties. Our research demonstrated the significant potential of AI in providing real-time assistance; however, we also identified several challenges that persist even with AI integration. Our work discusses these obstacles and offers insights to guide future research in leveraging AI to deliver more effective real-time support.

There is lack of real-time communication support tools for Non-native speakers to organize speaking content due to their limited cognitive resources and second language insufficiency. In this series of studies, we focused on first investigating their speaking difficulties and tring to provide appropriate AI-driven tools for them to facilitate the communication process. -->
